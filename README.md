#Diving deep into Predicting the type of Cancer:

#Project Motivation:

From a research it was found that, Breast Cancer was one of the main reasons of death in
women world wide & specially in USA. The detection of Cancer at early stages can 
save many lives as cancer is curable upto certain stage.
Our Machine Learning Algorithms are just samples to contribute towards achieving this.
 
Our Algorithm is able to predict the type of cancer in order to avoid any kind of delays in
the treatement of it.

File Description:

--A Descriptive Jupyter Notebook
--One dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/merishnasuwal/breast-cancer-prediction-dataset

Results of Analysis:
Our model was able to predict 98.9% accuracy in predicting the type of cancer
